Among the most interesting activities carried out by humans is the act of communication, cooperation, and collaboration with one another. Lately, AI models have demonstrated remarkable advancements in performing these activities and have emerged as a significant component in this information ecosystem.

The <span class="group-name">Communication & Intelligence (C&I)</span> group is dedicated to understanding these mysterious new machines and their behaviors and to studying new types of interactions that can facilitate humans and AI models to communicate, cooperate, and collaborate with each other.

# Who are we?

Currently, we're a team of seven human PIs and their students: Kawin Ethayarajh, Ari Holtzman, Mina Lee, Karen Livescu, Will Merrill, Chenhao Tan, and Nick Tomlin from the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a> and <a href="https://www.ttic.edu/">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>. Please see our [People](/people/) page for the full list of faculty, affiliated faculty, postdocs, and students.

# Why Communication & Intelligence?
We could call ourselves yet another NLP group. However, NLP is not the most precise label for describing all of our research interests. If we interpret NLP as anything related to language, then this term describes many of our activities. Anyone who thinks of themselves as an NLP researcher should feel at home here. However, our interests also include communication beyond language, as well as intelligence as it relates to communication. Therefore, “Communication & Intelligence” offers a natural label for us.
