**Welcome to the UChicago NLP Group!**

Weâ€™re thrilled to have you here, exploring the exciting world of Natural Language Processing with us. Our dynamic team, led by the brilliant faculty members Ari Holtzman, Mina Lee, and Chenhao Tan, is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of NLP research. (Note that "dynamic" and "brilliant" come from the 09/25/23 version of ChatGPT.)

We believe that NLP has entered a new era, and we are primarily interested in the following three directions:
* Characterizing, explaining, and controlling AI behavior
* Empowering and enhancing humans
* Ecosystems of humans and AI
