This symposium is a place to discuss how to think about the intertwining of Communication and Intelligence in an age of machines that talk back. We increasingly interact with technology that attempts (simulates?) communication with humans, rather than just signaling information passively for a user to interpret. While the term “AI” has been around since the 50’s, the explosion of products, services, and bots that create a complex dialogue with their users (and even among themselves!) has created a phase shift in how we interact with machines that wield language. How should we study AI that communicates, rather than just solves a well-defined problem on its own? What are the structures of the new communication networks AI helps create, spanning people, machines, and institutions? What "counts" as communication and can AI help us decompose how it works more clearly? Can machines that communicate help us communicate better? Or are they merely eroding and biasing our human communication by polluting the commons? In this symposium we will discuss how communication and intelligence interact—in humans, in machines, and between them.

## Call for poster presentations

We invite all researchers and practitioners to submit poster presentations for the Symposium on Communication & Intelligence. This is an opportunity to showcase your work, share insights, and engage in discussions about the intersection of AI and human communication. We are particularly interested in presentations that examine opportunities and challenges to achieve complementary and beneficent AI. Automation will happen inevitably—but where are the opportunities for symbiosis?
Poster presenters will have the opportunity to display their posters at the Symposium and engage with fellow attendees during poster sessions. This is a chance to receive feedback, establish collaborations, and contribute to meaningful conversations about the future of interaction between humans and AI. Please submit your abstract <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIx0iqGnwqI0i5lbilzWGnl9lfe94bjgcZsN1Kzb1oqa9mXw/viewform?usp=pp_url'>here</a> by October 5th.
